<b>Who am I?</b>
<hr>
<p>My name is Monte Fischer. I was born in South Saint Paul, MN, USA, in one of the concluding years of the twentieth century. After my childhood and public high school education in Minnesota, I headed southwards to study at the University of Georgia in Athens, GA.</p>

<p>I am majoring in Mathematics and Computer Science. I started college in August 2016, and I will graduate in May 2020 with a B.S./M.A. in Mathematics and a B.S. in Computer Science.</p>

<p>My education at UGA is paid for (and more) by the <a href="https://honors.uga.edu/c_s/scholarships/f_f/foundation_fellows.html">UGA Foundation Fellowship</a>. This scholarship has fully funded my travel and study around the world (New York, NY; Washington D.C.; Oxford, UK; Costa Rica; Budapest, Hungary; Bali; etc.) and given me access to a driven and endlessly stimulating community of peers.</p>

<b>Where am I?</b>
<hr>

<p style="text-align:center;>"> GA &#8594; NY/DC &#8594; UK &#8594; EU &#8594; GA &#8594; CR &#8594; MA &#8594; HU &#8594; GA &#8594; ID &#8594; NY &#8594; <b>GA</b> &#8594; ? &#8594; WI</p>

<p>Spring 2020 is my last semester at UGA! I'm working on reconstructing video using neural networks for my master's thesis, with Dr. Alexander Petukhov as my advisor.</p>

<p>I spent summer 2019 in New York City, interning at the Federal Reserve (all views on this site my own, etc.) for the summer. I worked in Research under Dr. Michael Lee of the Money and Payment Studies function.</p>

<p>I spent the fall of my junior year studying abroad in Budapest at the Budapest Semester in Mathematics program. BSM plunges undergraduates (mostly Americans, some other nations were represented also) into the rich mathematical tradition of Hungary by means of interesting classes taught by Hungarian mathematicians. I took 4 hard math/CS classes, got to know some of the brightest of my peers, and explored Budapest. I had my sights on this program since high school, and it was fulfilling to finally go.</p>

<p>Before this, I spent the summer after my sophomore year at Worcester Polytechnic Institute with a industry-sponsored / NSF-funded financial mathematics research group. When I wasn't working I was walking around Worcester, MA (the second-largest city in New England that, somehow, is relatively unknown to the rest of the country) or walking around Boston.</p>
